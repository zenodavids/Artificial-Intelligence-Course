# Six Principles for Effective Prompt Crafting

- Principle 1: Start simple and iterate

  - Starting with a simple prompt and iterating allows for tweaking and refining.
  - Begin with a straightforward and concise prompt and gradually refine it.

- Principle 2: Clearly define the desired output

  - Clearly define the specific output you want from the model.
  - Specify the format, structure, and level of detail expected in the response.

- Principle 3: Use explicit instructions

  - Be explicit and specific in the instructions given to the model.
  - Clearly state what you want the model to do, avoiding ambiguity.

- Principle 4: Provide context and constraints

  - Give the model relevant context and constraints to guide its responses.
  - Incorporate relevant information or constraints to make the prompt more effective.

- Principle 5: Balance guidance and freedom

  - Provide enough guidance to steer the model in the right direction.
  - Avoid being overly prescriptive, allowing the model some freedom for creative responses.

- Principle 6: Few-shot learning: examples, examples, examples

  - Continuously iterate and experiment with different prompts to improve performance.
  - Test various prompts, assess results, and refine accordingly to optimize the model's output.

## Example:

### instead of :

"What is the best programming language I should learn?‚Äù

### use:

"What is the most versatile programming language for data science and machine-learning?"
