# Consistent Styles

Consistent styles and iamges can be achieved by using an image URL in the prompt. Use this technique to create multiple versions of the same character or image.

## Image as a Prompt

pass a URL of the image

**/imagine http://www.imgur.com/Im3424.jpg man walking across the street**

The generated image will take cues from both the seed image (from the URL you passed) and the text prompts.

> You can give multiple images as prompts

Consistent Styles Using URL Prompt

> To stay consistent, youâ€™ll need to describe the character in the URL image + the scene you want them in.
