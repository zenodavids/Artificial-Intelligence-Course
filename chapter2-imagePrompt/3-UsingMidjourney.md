# Using Midjourney

after joining the **_beta_** in their website, locate the **_newbies_** room in their discord and start in newbie chatroom.

## Getting started

- type **_/imagine_** + enter in the Discord chat for your newbies room. This will create a prompt field where you can type the image description. When finished, select Enter to send your prompt.

## Be precise

The more precise you can be with your description, the better the AI will produce good results. Be descriptive, and if thereâ€™s a particular style that you are looking for, include it in your description.

## Results

Give Midjourney a minute to generate your images. Typically, the AI will create several different versions based on your description. You now have several options to continue.

- once it is ready, your results shows at the bottom of the chatroom.

- just below your result (pictures), you will see:

  - _v1, v2, v3, v4, u1, u2, u3, u4 and the refresh icon._
    - v1 - v4: allows you to choose from the oldest version(_v1_), to the newest(_v4_). if you want to further edit manually click on the v1 or any other versions and an input box will come up for you to add more text.
    - u1 - u4: allows you to upscale(_further edit_) the pictures based on their versions.

### DM yourself the results

When finished, you can DM (direct message) the image directly to yourself by selecting the Envelope emoji and adding it to your chat. That allows you to save and download the image whenever you want.
