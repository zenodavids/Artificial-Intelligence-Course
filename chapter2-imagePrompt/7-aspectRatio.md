# Aspect Ratio

The **_-aspect_** or **_-ar_** parameter is the width-to-height ratio of an image.
It is two numbers separated by a colon, such as 7:4 or 4:3.

## How to Use Aspect Ratio Parameters

**/imagine jasmine in the wild flower** **--ar 4:3**

for a custom image size , use the following example;
**/imagine jasmine in the wild flower** **--w 600 --h 300**

> A square image has equal width and height, described as a 1:1 aspect ratio. The image could be 1000px × 1000px, or 1500px × 1500px, and the aspect ratio would still be 1:1. A computer screen might have a ratio of 16:10. The width is 1.6 times longer than the height. So the image could be 1600px × 1000px, 4000px × 2000px, 320px x 200px, etc.

> **The default aspect ratio is 1:1**.
> Use** 139:100** instead of **1.39:1**.
