# Remixing

To keep working on an image, you’ll need to activate **_remix_** mode.

## Activate remix mode

- Type **_/settings_** and hit enter in Discord.
- Toggle on ‘Remix mode’ (it should be blue).
- Select an image to remix.
- Once you’ve generated the 4 image grid, now selecting one variant will open the remix prompt box.
- Adjust the prompt in this mode as you see fit.
