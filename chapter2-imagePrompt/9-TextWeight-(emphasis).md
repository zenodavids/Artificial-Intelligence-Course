# Text Weights

You can put more or less emphasis on parts of your prompt, Add ::[a number] behind a keyword or phrase to add a weight.

> Prompt weights look like this: **_a car::1 a boy on a beach::1.5 painting --ar 16:9_**

# MidJourney Image Weights

Image weights, on the other hand, are a way to shape image generation when using an image(s) as part of your image prompt.

> Image prompts look like this: **http://myflagurl.com flag on a summer day --iw .75 --ar 16:9**

> Note: you can use both types of weighting together for an even more powerful effect.

## Negative weights

This is a process of removing something from your prompt.

So either use **_car::-0.5_** or **_--no car_**
