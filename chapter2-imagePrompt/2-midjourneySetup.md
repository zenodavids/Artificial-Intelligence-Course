- 1 Midjourney works through a chat program called Discord. Go to Discord.com and create an account. It’s completely free.

  > I recommend downloading the desktop client for easier use

- 2 Visit the Midjourney website and choose ‘Join the Beta’

- 3 Now accept the Midjourney Discord invite

- 4 Now open Discord (if it doesn’t open automatically)

- 5 Select the Midjourney Icon on the left menu bar. It’s an icon of a ship.

- 6 In the Midjourney channels, find the **Newcomer** rooms. There will typically be several newcomer rooms open, with names like “newbies-108.” You can select any of these to begin.
