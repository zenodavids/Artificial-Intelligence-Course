# Prompt Structure

The more descriptive your text is, the more vibrant and unique the output will be.

> The Midjourney Bot does not understand words like humans.

- More specific synonyms work better. ie Instead of big, try _gigantic_, _enormous_, or _immense_.

- Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts.

### Focus on What you Want

- It is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want.
- To ensure an object is not in the final image, advance prompting using the **_--no parameter_**.

### Think About What Details Matter

Anything left unsaid may surprise you. anything you leave out will be randomized.

## Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about:

- **_Subject_**: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.
- **_Medium_**: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.
- **_Environment_**: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the Emerald City, etc.
- **_Lighting_**: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etc
- **_Color_**: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.
- **_Mood_**: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.
- **_Composition_**: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.

> Plural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. "Three cats" is more specific than "cats." Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of "birds.”
